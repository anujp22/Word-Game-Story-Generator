In a $1 world filled with $2s, one $3 decided to $4 to the $5. Little did they know, a $6 was also making their way to the $7 to $8. When the two arrived at the $9, hilarity ensued as they found themselves in one ridiculous situation after another. In the end, the $3 and the $11 became fast friends and continued to $12 and $13 together.
