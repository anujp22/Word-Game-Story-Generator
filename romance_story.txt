Once upon a time, there was a adj1 noun1 named Jack who fell in love with a adj2 adj1 noun2 named Jill. Jack would verb1 to the top of a place1 every day just to catch a glimpse of Jill. One day, Jack finally mustered up the courage to verb2 Jill out on a date to the place2. To Jack's delight, Jill said yes, and they lived happily ever after.
